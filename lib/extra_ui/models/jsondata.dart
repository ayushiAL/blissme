So, we can say GST is one tax, one nation and it is providing revenue to the government\nGST is India’s first major sweeping tax reform in decades. This regime has rationalised tax collection and simplified compliance procedures to a great extent.\nBusinesses that once had to register for a wide range of taxes, i.e., VAT, Excise Duty, Service Tax, CST, Octroi, Luxury Tax and Entertainment Tax, — now only require a GST registration.\nGST is strictly an Indirect tax applied to the cost of certain goods and services while Income tax comes under Direct tax. This value-added tax is levied on all goods and service providers in the domestic market.\nHowever, not all businesses require a registration.\nAny business offering sale of goods with annual turnover of Rs 40 lacs or service with annual turnover of 20 lacs would require the registration for GST and have a valid GST Number. Remember that the GST is levied on supply, not sales.\nTherefore, stock-taking, discounts and freebies also come under the GST net. Businesses selling to other states must register for GST, regardless of turnover."

A variety of Central taxes like Service Tax, Excise Duty, CST and state taxes like Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, Octroi, VAT are absorbed in one tax – GST, implemented on 01.07.2017.  GST is to be charged at every step of the supply chain, with full set-off benefits available. The procedure for GST is entirely online and requires no manual intervention.\nEvery product goes through multiple stages along the supply chain, which includes the purchasing of raw materials, manufacturing, sale to the wholesaler, selling to the retailer and then the final sale to the consumer. Interestingly,  GST will be levied on all of these 3 stages. Let’s say if a product is produced in West Bengal but is being consumed in Uttar Pradesh, the entire revenue will go to Uttar Pradesh.\nAlso, taxpayers with a turnover of less than Rs.1.5 crore can choose composition scheme to get rid of tedious GST formalities and pay GST at a fixed rate of turnover."

For employees earning more than ₹21,000 per month, including basic salaries and dearness allowance, the insurance is deducted from their pay.\nAlso, taxpayers with a turnover of less than ₹1.5 crore can opt for the composition scheme to get rid of tedious GST formalities and pay GST at a fixed rate of turnover."

Within 15 days of passing the resolution the statement of assets and liabilities after the closure of accounts, to the date of winding up of the LLP, attested by at least two partners must be submitted. A report of the valuation of company assets must be prepared. Once this has been done, the majority of partners need to make a declaration to the effect that the LLP has no debts or that it is in a position to pay all debts within a specified period, not exceeding one year from the date of winding up of the company.\nWhile registering for a business, you have different options like LLP or Limited Liability Partnership. If you have registered your company as LLP, then you would be required to file mandatory returns whether it is doing business or not. In case you fail to file the returns, then the LLP will be subjected to penalties under the LLP Act, and the partners in the firm will be liable to the same penalties. Hence, filing returns becomes a mandatory act in the case of LLP.\nSo, if you are not planning to file the return and close the LLP for certain reasons, then it must be closed as per the LLP Act. Taxpatra is a popular name when it comes to registration or closure of the LLP.\nIf you are willing to close the LLP, then it must meet the following conditions:\nThe LLP should be inactive for a period of at least 1 year, or it should be inoperative from the date of establishment.\nThe second condition is that the LLP should not have any assets on the date of application.\nMoreover, there is detailed paperwork that needs to be done. The first thing that you need to do is to submit the application along with the required fees and affidavit along with consent from all partners of LLP. In addition, for the closure of LLP, you need to submit the IT return and a Statement of Accounts (of the last 30 days) from the date of application.\nAt this point, you must know that the closure of LLP can take up to two months, provided the partners are quick to complete the procedures involved."

                  "In India, court marriage is solemnized either by the Marriage Act of 1954 or the Special Marriage Act. Under both these Acts, a court marriage process can be performed when a person marries someone of the opposite sex and the man is above 21 years and the woman is above 18 years of age.\nThe Hindu Marriage Act comes into force when both parties are Hindus. For inter-caste marriages, court marriage is conducted under the Special Marriage Act.\nThe parties can be of Indian or foreign descent. The court marriage rules include other conditions such as the parties should not be in an existing marriage with other persons and that they should be of sound mind.\nA court marriage does away with rituals and ceremonies and is simple. The procedure of court marriage is performed by the Marriage Registrar and upon completion; the participants are given a court marriage certificate stating that their union is legal in the eyes of the law.\nThe court marriage is gaining popularity in India and many couples are opting for it these days. There are numerous reasons why court marriage rules are the preferred choices these days. One of the reasons for this is that couples want to keep their marriage economical and simple. Other reasons are because of an increase in the number of inter-caste marriages, or marriages without the blessings of the families. Whatever be the case, court marriage is not a simple affair. It involves a lot of procedures and the participants need to bear court marriage fees as well."

A trust functions on the objective of eradicating poverty, providing education to the underprivileged and offering medical relief apart from the generalized aim of promoting arts, science and literature. It is to be noted that trusts are irrevocable which means they cannot be amended or terminated without the permission of the court. Taxpatra helps in providing you with the trust registration certificate with a few documents like a deed of trust, rental agreement, etc.\nIn India, there are no specific laws to govern the public trust, however, some states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have their own public trust Act."
